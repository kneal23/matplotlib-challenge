Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company, mice study

Summary included below as I'm not sure if it saved in the notebook. Data listed as "_final".

### Analysis

Over the course of 45 days, Pymaceuticals tested a number of anti-cancer medications for potential treatmenets of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and using Capomulin as the basis of analysis to compare the other drug treatments. During trials, it was noted that the drug, Capomulin, showed a steady decrease in tumor size over an extended period of time. Onaverage tumor size showed  strong correlation between 
mice that weighed more and the increased size of the tumor prior to trials. The treatment, Ramicane, showed similar results as Capomulin with regard to tumor shrinkage over an extended period of time. The average final tumor size for mice that used Capomulin was 40.675741 as compared to Ramicane's average final tumor size of 40.216745. The Placebo final, average tumor size was 54.033581.
